Hi
node scrips pre/post-x will run before and after x
cdk command automatically does compile so dont need to tsc
mkdrip is for create directory
rimraf cleans directory

either going to do pre-post's in npm scripts and leave out those phases from buildspec, most likely going to do this

dev dependencies 
dependancies in process of creating artifact

dependancies - keep fixed as possible, deve dep more flexible (more operating sys like mkdir) but functional stuff like cdk keep kixed ish
^ - any minor version version or above
~ - major version
